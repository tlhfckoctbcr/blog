# The Scout Law

### What is this?
This website is a dedication to the twelve principles of the Scout Law, a set of rules that has helped, and continues to help, me thoughout my life. I am not a perfect man, and sometimes I find myself veering away from the righteous path in life; however, the Scout Law has never failed to correct my course. I am forever grateful to Scouting and the lessons I learned from my fraternal peers and mentors.
